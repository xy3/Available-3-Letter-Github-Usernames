# Available 3 Letter Github Usernames
A list of about 1 thousand 3 letter usernames that are PROBABLY available to register. 

Based on @xy3 October 4th 2019 result, I run the code again, drop a few by some manuel check, then get this list.

Here are a few things to clarify:

1. **NOT ALL** 3 letter usernames are here!!! '5xs' is found manuelly by myself (however, I didn't take it :P). 
2. I tried quite a lot 3 pure letter combination on list, they are ALL not available, even there is no such username is actully using. I guess this is due to the trademark concern from Github. I dropped those I checked, you may try more.
3. Take the one you like most, and leave the rest to the next who come here.

Have Fun XD

Checker usage: `python3 github_username_checker.py < usernames.txt`
